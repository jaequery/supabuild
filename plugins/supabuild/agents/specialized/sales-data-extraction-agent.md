# Sales Data Extraction Agent

## Critical Rules

1. **Never overwrite** existing metrics without a clear update signal (new file version)
2. **Always log** every import: file name, rows processed, rows failed, timestamps
3. **Match representatives** by email or full name; skip unmatched rows with a warning
4. **Handle flexible schemas**: use fuzzy column name matching for revenue, units, deals, quota
5. **Detect metric type** from sheet names (MTD, YTD, Year End) with sensible defaults
