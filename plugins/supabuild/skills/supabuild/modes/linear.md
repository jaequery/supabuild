## §C — `linear`

You are a backlog runner. For every open Linear ticket in **Todo** status,
you launch the §A build flow against that ticket's description and
ship a **separate PR** per ticket. Never bundle multiple tickets into one
PR. Every build must meet the clean-code bar in §C.3a.

### C.0. Inputs

`/supabuild linear [task description] [flags]`.

**Positional arg (optional).** If a free-form task description is
passed, **create the ticket on the fly first** (in Todo state, on
`--team`), then proceed with normal queue processing — the new
ticket is included in this run's queue. Use:

```bash
linear issue create \
  --title "<first line of description, ≤80 chars>" \
  --description-file /tmp/ltb-new-$$.md \
  --state Todo \
  ${TEAM:+--team "$TEAM"} \
  ${ASSIGNEE:+--assignee "$ASSIGNEE"} \
  --json
```

The remainder of the description goes in `--description-file`. If
`--team` is unset and the workspace has multiple teams, abort with
a message asking the user to pass `--team`. Echo the new ticket's
identifier and URL before continuing.

Optional flags:
- `--team <key>` — Linear team key (e.g. `ENG`). Default: all teams the
  API key can see.
- `--assignee <me|email|userId>` — filter to one assignee. Default: any.
- `--limit <n>` — cap how many tickets to process this run. Default: 10.
- `--target <branch>` — base branch for PRs. Default: `main`.
- `--parallel <n>` — process N tickets concurrently. **Default: 1
  (sequential).** Pass an explicit number to parallelize. Warn if
  effective concurrency exceeds 5 (shared `gh`/Linear rate limits)
  but do not cap.
- `--steps <csv>` — explicit comma-separated set of verification gates
  (`review`, `qa`, `security`, `polish`, `walkthrough`). Bypasses the
  §C.0.6 checkbox prompt and passes through to §A as
  `SUPABUILD_STEPS=<csv>`. Empty value disables every gate. See
  §A.0.6 for the canonical token table.
- `--configure` — re-prompt the §C.0.6 checkboxes even if a cached
  selection exists in `git config supabuild.linearSteps`.
- `--dry-run` — list tickets that would be processed and stop.

**No confirmation prompt. Ever.** If invoked with no flags, just
start — defaults are: up to 10 tickets, sequential, base = `main`,
default clean-code bar. Print the resolved settings + ticket queue,
then **immediately proceed to §C.1 preflight and §C.2 ticket
processing in the same response, without asking the user "proceed?",
"yes/no?", or any other confirmation phrasing**. Asking is a bug —
the user already confirmed by invoking the skill. Only stop early if
`--dry-run` is set or preflight (§C.1) fails. The §C.0.6
step-selection prompt is *configuration*, not run confirmation: it
asks once per run (cached default makes reruns one keystroke), is
silent when `--steps` is passed, and never gates the queue itself.

### Linear interface — `@schpet/linear-cli`

**All Linear interactions in this skill go through the `linear` CLI
([`@schpet/linear-cli`](https://github.com/schpet/linear-cli)), not
raw GraphQL.** The CLI handles auth via stored workspace credentials
(`linear auth login`), so `LINEAR_API_KEY` is not required directly.

Canonical commands used below:
- `linear auth token` — verifies a credential is configured.
- `linear issue query --state unstarted --json [--team K] [--assignee U] [--limit N]`
  — fetch issues. Filter to "Todo" by `state.name` in the JSON output.
- `linear issue update <ID> --state "<name>"` — transition workflow state
  by name (e.g. `"In Progress"`, `"In Review"`, `"Todo"`).
- `linear issue comment add <ID> --body-file <path>` — post a comment
  (use `--body-file` for any multi-line markdown).
- `linear issue view <ID> --json` — fetch a single issue with full
  fields (description, attachments, labels) when needed.

Only fall back to `linear api '<graphql>'` (the CLI's raw-API escape
hatch) if a needed field is not exposed by a structured subcommand.
**Never** call `curl https://api.linear.app/graphql` directly.

### C.0.6. Workflow step selection (run-level batcher for §A.0.6)

§C is a destination adapter — its only job is to feed §A one ticket at
a time. The verification-step contract (`SUPABUILD_STEPS=<csv>`, the
five tokens, what each gates) is owned by §A.0.6 and §A.0.7. This
section is the **run-level batcher** of that prompt: ask once per
`/supabuild linear` run instead of once per ticket, then relay the
answer to every per-ticket §A invocation via the build prompt body.

For the canonical token table, prompt copy, and parsing rules, see
§A.0.6. This section does not redefine any of that — it just decides
*when* to ask and where to cache the answer.

#### Resolution order (mirrors §A.0.6 with linear-scoped cache)

1. **`--steps <csv>` was passed.** Parse, validate, set
   `STEPS_CSV` to canonical sorted CSV, skip the prompt. Persist:
   ```bash
   git config supabuild.linearSteps "$STEPS_CSV"
   ```
2. **`--configure` was passed.** Force the prompt regardless of
   cached value.
3. **Cached value exists.** Read
   `git config --get supabuild.linearSteps`. Empty string is a valid
   "all off" cache. Default checkbox state to that, then prompt.
4. **No cache.** Default all five checkboxes to checked, then prompt.

#### The prompt

Same `AskUserQuestion` multi-select as §A.0.6, but framed for the
batch:

```
Q: Which gates should run for every ticket this run?
   (uncheck to skip; implementation rounds always run)
```

Persist the user's choice:
```bash
git config supabuild.linearSteps "$STEPS_CSV"
```

Print the run banner:
```
## /supabuild linear — gates: review, qa, security
(skipped: polish, walkthrough)
```

If `STEPS_CSV` is empty:
```
## /supabuild linear — gates: NONE
heads up: all gates off — every ticket will ship after implementation
rounds with no QA, code review, security audit, polish pass, or
walkthrough capture. The Team Lead's own integration check is the
only thing standing between each diff and its PR.
```

#### Relay to §A

The resolved CSV is stashed in `STEPS_CSV` and spliced into every
per-ticket build prompt at §C.3c (see the build prompt template
there) as `SUPABUILD_STEPS=$STEPS_CSV`. Splice the line literally,
including the empty case — `SUPABUILD_STEPS=` is the explicit
"orchestrator opted out of every gate" signal that §A.0.7
distinguishes from "no orchestrator signal at all".

### C.1. Preflight

On first run on a fresh machine, the `linear` CLI, the `gh` CLI, and
either tool's auth state may all be missing. **Detect every gap in
one pass before bailing** — printing one fix at a time turns a
single fresh-machine setup into four round-trips and makes the user
feel nagged. Auto-resolve the steps that don't require browser
interaction; surface a consolidated walkthrough for the rest.

1. **Setup walkthrough (CLIs + auth).**

   **a. Detect all gaps in one pass.** Do not abort yet — collect
   into a list. Skip the auth check when the matching install check
   already failed (the auth command would fail for an unrelated
   reason and pollute the report):
   ```bash
   GAPS=()
   if command -v linear >/dev/null 2>&1; then
     linear auth token >/dev/null 2>&1 || GAPS+=("linear-auth")
   else
     GAPS+=("linear-install")
   fi
   if command -v gh >/dev/null 2>&1; then
     gh auth status >/dev/null 2>&1 || GAPS+=("gh-auth")
   else
     GAPS+=("gh-install")
   fi
   ```

   **b. If `GAPS` is empty,** continue to step 2.

   **c. Otherwise, print one consolidated header** — "First-time
   setup for `/supabuild linear` on this machine" — then list every
   gap so the user sees the full setup at once. Auto-run the install
   gaps; the auth gaps must be done by the user in their own
   terminal because both tools' login flows open a browser and the
   skill cannot complete OAuth on the user's behalf.

   **d. `linear-install`** — auto-run, in this order until one
   succeeds:
   - `command -v brew` ⇒ `brew install schpet/tap/linear-cli`
   - else `command -v npm` ⇒ `npm i -g @schpet/linear-cli`
   - else stop with: "install Node.js (or Homebrew on macOS) so the
     skill can install `@schpet/linear-cli`, then re-run."
   Re-check `command -v linear` after install; if still missing,
   surface the install command's stderr and stop.

   **e. `gh-install`** — auto-run when possible:
   - macOS with `brew` ⇒ `brew install gh`
   - Debian/Ubuntu (apt available) ⇒ print the official install
     snippet from `https://cli.github.com/manual/installation` and
     stop (the keyring + apt-source dance is fragile to auto-run
     non-interactively).
   - Otherwise ⇒ print "install `gh` from https://cli.github.com"
     and stop.
   Re-check `command -v gh` after install.

   **f. `linear-auth`** — cannot be auto-resolved. Print:
   > Run `linear auth login` in your terminal, pick the workspace,
   > then re-run `/supabuild linear`.
   And stop the skill (do not proceed to §C.2).

   **g. `gh-auth`** — same:
   > Run `gh auth login` in your terminal (pick GitHub.com → HTTPS →
   > authenticate via browser), then re-run `/supabuild linear`.
   And stop.

   **h. After auto-installs, re-detect.** If any `*-auth` gap
   remains, print all remaining auth instructions together (so the
   user runs both `linear auth login` and `gh auth login` in one
   sitting before re-invoking) and stop. Never assume browser auth
   completed — always require a re-invocation.

2. **Repo state.** `git status --porcelain` must be empty, or
   surfaced and confirmed by the user.
3. **§A reachable.** This skill invokes the build flow inline
   (this skill owns the build flow, so it just runs its own §A);
   confirm that the §A section is loaded in this skill before
   proceeding.
4. **Capture run-level state once** (so per-ticket loops don't
   re-derive identical values, and parallel jobs share a single
   resolved value rather than racing). Set:
   ```bash
   LINEAR_TOKEN=$(linear auth token --workspace "$WORKSPACE" 2>/dev/null \
     || linear auth token 2>/dev/null)
   LTB_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/ltb-cache-$$
   mkdir -p "$LTB_CACHE_DIR"
   ```
   - **`LINEAR_TOKEN`** is reused by §C.3a-img for `uploads.linear.app`
     downloads — derive once here, never per-ticket. Empty token →
     log a warning; image hydration in §C.3a-img will downgrade to
     skip rather than block any build.
   - **`$LTB_CACHE_DIR/issue-<IDENT>.json`** caches each ticket's
     full issue JSON; written once per ticket in §C.2 (or after a
     hydration re-fetch) and read by §C.3-state, §C.3a-pre, §C.3d,
     §C.3e. Replaces ~3 redundant `linear issue view --json` calls
     per ticket. If a write mutation in §C.3-design changes labels
     and a follow-up consistency check needs the latest, re-fetch
     and overwrite the cache file — caching never blocks a
     verification re-read, only the read-only lookups.
   - **`$LTB_CACHE_DIR/states-<TEAM_KEY>.json`** caches each team's
     `WorkflowState` list; written on first lookup in §C.3-state
     and reused by §C.3-design and §C.3e for the same team. State
     lists are stable across the run; teams rarely add/remove states
     mid-burndown. Across a run of 10 tickets on one team this
     cuts the `linear api` state-list fetch from ~10× to 1×.
   - Cache directory is removed at the end of §C.5.

### C.2. Fetch the Todo queue

Linear's "Todo" is a `WorkflowState` of type `unstarted` named `Todo`
(case-insensitive). Use the CLI's structured query, then post-filter
the JSON output by state name.

```bash
linear issue query \
  --state unstarted \
  --json \
  --limit "${LIMIT:-10}" \
  ${TEAM:+--team "$TEAM"} \
  ${ASSIGNEE:+--assignee "$ASSIGNEE"}
```

For `--assignee me`, pass `self` (the CLI resolves it). Then in the
JSON, keep only nodes whose `state.name` matches `Todo`
(case-insensitive); if a team has no exact `Todo` state, fall back to
all `unstarted` results for that team and note the substitution in
the printed table.

**Sub-tickets are NOT enqueued at the top level.** Filter out any
issue whose `parent` field is non-null — sub-issues are processed
*inside* their parent's slot, in the parent's `children` order, so
that dependency chains authored by the human (parent first, then
sub-tasks in order) are respected. The top-level queue is roots only.

```bash
# After fetching + Todo-filtering, drop any ticket that has a parent.
# `linear issue query` returns `.parent.id` as null/absent for roots.
QUEUE_JSON=$(echo "$QUEUE_JSON" | jq '[.[] | select(.parent == null or .parent.id == null)]')
```

If a root ticket's children are themselves not in `Todo`, they are
skipped during expansion (§C.3-children) — only `Todo`-state children
are processed. The queue table prints roots only; child counts appear
inline on each row, e.g. `ENG-123  [P1]  "Add OAuth login"  (alice@…)  +3 sub-tickets`.

If a returned issue is missing `description`, `attachments`, or
`labels`, hydrate it with `linear issue view <ID> --json`.

**Persist each issue's final JSON** (post-hydration if it ran) to
`$LTB_CACHE_DIR/issue-<IDENT>.json`. This file is the canonical
read source for §C.3-state, §C.3a-pre, §C.3d, and §C.3e — those
sections must `jq` against this file rather than re-running
`linear issue view "$IDENT" --json`. Cuts ~3 Linear reads per
ticket and lets parallel mode (§C.4) share already-fetched data
across jobs.

Sort: `priority` ascending (1=urgent first; 0=no-priority last), then
`updatedAt` ascending. Apply `--limit`. Print a numbered table:

```
# Linear Todo queue (N tickets)
1. ENG-123  [P1]  "Add OAuth login"          (alice@…)
2. ENG-130  [P2]  "Fix invoice rounding"     (bob@…)
```

If `--dry-run`, stop. Otherwise proceed immediately against all N
tickets — no confirmation prompt.

### C.3. Per-ticket loop

For each selected ticket, in order, run the sub-routine below. Print
the running results table after each ticket finishes.

#### C.3-route. Decide the path: design exploration vs. direct build

Before any branch resolution or dispatch, route the ticket. There
are three possible outcomes per ticket; pick the first that matches:

1. **AWAITING_HUMAN** — ticket has the label `Choose Design` (any
   case) **AND does NOT have `design-selected`**. A previous
   `/supabuild linear` run already produced variants and the
   human hasn't signaled a pick yet. Skip this ticket entirely:
   do **not** transition state, do **not** post a comment, do
   **not** dispatch. Record verdict `AWAITING_HUMAN` in the
   results table and continue to the next ticket.

   The `AND NOT design-selected` clause matters: a human who adds
   `design-selected` *without* removing `Choose Design` (a common,
   forgivable slip) would otherwise be stuck here forever. The
   `design-selected` label is the stronger signal — if it's
   present, the human has picked, period.

2. **DESIGN_EXPLORATION** — UI heuristic fires (label or keyword
   rules below) **AND** the ticket has no signal that design has
   already been chosen **AND** no bug-report counter-signal fires.
   Signals that design is done (any one ⇒ skip this path and fall
   through to BUILD):
   - label `design-selected` is present, OR
   - label `design-explored` is present (we write this in §C.3-design
     step 5 once variants have been posted; it survives across
     runs as a structural "this ticket already went through the
     design loop" marker).

   Bug-report counter-signals (any one ⇒ skip this path and fall
   through to BUILD, even if the UI heuristic fires):
   - title starts with `Bug:` (case-insensitive, optional leading
     whitespace) — explicit author signal that this is a defect,
     not a design exploration.
   - description contains **both** `Expected:` and `Actual:`
     (case-insensitive, anywhere in body) — the canonical
     bug-report template shape; presence of both fields means
     the author has already pinned down a binary "what should
     happen vs. what does happen" requirement, which is a
     deterministic build, not a divergent design problem.

   The counter-signals matter because the keyword list below is
   intentionally broad ("button", "form", "modal" etc.) and will
   fire on any UI bug. Without this carve-out, the routing wastes
   a §B round on a defect whose fix is binary. PIN-80
   ("Bug: …button…") was the canonical case that motivated this
   rule.

   When this path matches, run §C.3-design and continue the queue —
   do NOT run the §C.3a-pre…§C.3f build path for this ticket.

   **Why a label, not a comment marker?** Labels are returned by
   the same `linear issue view --json` call that fetches the
   ticket, so detection is one read. A comment-body marker would
   require a second `comments{nodes{body}}` query and grep — more
   moving parts, more failure modes.

3. **BUILD** — everything else. Proceed to §C.3a-pre and run the
   normal §A build path through §C.3f.

UI heuristic for path 2 (any one fires):
- Label match: `^(ui|ux|design|frontend|web|mobile|needs-design)$`
  case-insensitive.
- Keyword match in title or description (case-insensitive,
  whole-word): `UI`, `UX`, design, layout, style, visual, page,
  screen, component, button, form, modal, theme, responsive,
  `dark mode`.

Print the route decision per ticket, e.g.
`ENG-123 → route=DESIGN_EXPLORATION (label "needs-design")` or
`ENG-124 → route=BUILD (bug-report counter-signal: "Bug:" prefix overrides UI keyword)`.

#### C.3-state. Move state to "In Progress" FIRST — before any comment

**State change is the very first mutation on the ticket.** The
moment §C.3-route says we're going to do real work (route is BUILD
or DESIGN_EXPLORATION), transition the workflow state to "In
Progress" *before* posting the §C.3-announce comment, before
hydrating images, before resolving branches, before any
long-running step. The Linear sidebar must reflect "the robot is
working on this right now" the instant any external observer
opens the ticket — not 30 seconds later when the announce comment
lands, not at §C.3b after image downloads, never. A ticket sitting
in "Todo" while the bot has already committed to working on it is
the bug this section exists to prevent.

Skip this section only when route is **AWAITING_HUMAN** — those
tickets are already in the state the human needs them in, and
mutating them would be wrong.

Resolve the target state explicitly — never pass `--state "In
Progress"` blindly. The CLI fuzzy-matches and on a team without an
exact "In Progress" can land in a downstream `completed` state.
Scope the search to the `started` type group:

```bash
# Read team key from the cached issue JSON (§C.2). Cache the team's
# WorkflowState list once per team, reuse for §C.3-design and §C.3e.
TEAM_KEY=$(jq -r '.team.key' "$LTB_CACHE_DIR/issue-$IDENT.json")
STATES_FILE="$LTB_CACHE_DIR/states-$TEAM_KEY.json"
if [ ! -f "$STATES_FILE" ]; then
  linear api '
    query($key:String!){ team(id:$key){ states{ nodes{ id name type } } } }
  ' --variables "$(jq -nc --arg key "$TEAM_KEY" '{key:$key}')" \
    > "$STATES_FILE"
fi
STATES_JSON=$(cat "$STATES_FILE")

# Pick the first In-Progress-flavored started state. NEVER cross into
# `completed` (Done, Ready for Deployment, Shipped) or `unstarted`.
PROGRESS_STATE=$(echo "$STATES_JSON" \
  | jq -r '[.data.team.states.nodes[]
            | select(.type=="started")
            | select(.name | test("^(In Progress|Building|In Development|Started|Doing)$"; "i"))]
            | .[0].name // empty')

if [ -n "$PROGRESS_STATE" ]; then
  linear issue update "$IDENT" --state "$PROGRESS_STATE" \
    || echo "warning: failed to move $IDENT to $PROGRESS_STATE; continuing"
else
  echo "warning: team $TEAM_KEY has no In-Progress-style started state; leaving $IDENT in Todo"
fi
```

The `select(.type=="started")` filter is load-bearing — it
prevents the CLI from ever fuzzy-matching into a `completed` or
`unstarted` state. On any failure, log a warning and continue —
do not block on Linear state, but the §C.3-announce comment that
follows must still describe the ticket as "in progress" (the
state move is best-effort but always *attempted* first, so the
comment narrative reflects intended state).

Print the transition per ticket, e.g.
`ENG-123 → state=In Progress (was Todo)`.

#### C.3-announce. Post a "picked up" comment AFTER the state move

For every ticket whose route is **BUILD** or **DESIGN_EXPLORATION**
(i.e. anything except AWAITING_HUMAN), post a Linear comment
immediately after §C.3-state — before §C.3a-pre, before image
hydration, before any long-running operation. Stakeholders
watching the ticket in Linear should see "the robot is on it" the
moment we commit to doing real work, not 5 minutes later when the
first phase comment lands. By the time this comment renders, the
ticket sidebar already shows "In Progress" (per §C.3-state), so the
announce comment reinforces what the state already says rather
than racing it.

```markdown
### 🤖 picked up by /supabuild linear

- **Route:** `$ROUTE` (`DESIGN_EXPLORATION` → variants first, then human picks; `BUILD` → straight to /supabuild build)
- **Why this route:** $ROUTE_REASON   <!-- e.g. "label `needs-design`", "keyword `modal` in title", "design-selected label present, going straight to build" -->
- **Position in queue:** $POS / $TOTAL

Next steps I'll narrate as I go — every state change, label change,
and dispatch will land here as a comment so you don't have to watch
the terminal. If something blocks, the blocker comment is the last
one before silence.
```

This is the FIRST comment on every active ticket, even before the
phase-specific "design exploration started" / "build started"
comments. The phase comments still post — this one is additive,
not a replacement. AWAITING_HUMAN never gets this comment (it's
the only carve-out from the "narrate everything" rule).

#### Label helper (used throughout §C.3)

Linear labels are managed via the `linear` CLI when supported, else
via `linear api`. The CLI's `issue update` accepts `--label <name>`
to add and `--remove-label <name>` to drop, but flag names vary by
version — if `linear issue update --help` doesn't list them, fall
back to `linear api` with `issueUpdate { labelIds }` after fetching
the team's label list (`team(id:$key){ labels{ nodes{ id name } } }`),
creating the label via `issueLabelCreate` if it doesn't exist on
the team yet, and writing the merged `labelIds` set. Labels created
by this skill: `Designing`, `Choose Design`, `design-explored`,
`design-selected`, `Building`, `Testing`. Label add/remove is
best-effort — log a warning on failure and continue; never block
dispatch on a label mutation.

**Exception to "best-effort":** `design-explored` MUST stick. If
adding it in §C.3-design step 4 fails, retry once via the `linear
api` fallback before giving up. Without it, the next run can't tell
the ticket already went through the design loop and will route it
back through the §B design flow — wasted variants, duplicate noise
on the ticket. If both attempts fail, surface a loud warning in the
final summary and append a `_design-explored label could not be
written — manual cleanup required_` line to the "variants ready"
comment so the human knows.

#### C.3-design. Design exploration path (route = DESIGN_EXPLORATION)

The ticket needs divergent variants before anyone writes code. We
hand it to the §B design flow (which wraps the variant build and
critique loop), let it post variant screenshots back to the ticket
(via the embedded Linear-aware design helper), then return the
ticket to **Todo** with `Choose Design` + `design-explored` labels
so a human can pick. The next `/supabuild linear` run will see
the `design-explored` label (or `design-selected` once the human
picks) and skip straight to BUILD.

State is already "In Progress" — §C.3-state moved it before §C.3-announce.

1. **Add label `Designing`.** Remove `needs-design` if present.
2. **Post the "starting design" comment** via `--body-file`:
   ```markdown
   ### 🎨 design exploration started

   Routing through the §B design flow because this ticket looks
   design-flavored (UI label or UX keywords in title/description).

   - The design flow is producing N divergent variants in parallel.
   - Each variant will land as its own comment on this ticket
     with screenshots and a per-variant git branch
     (`supabuild-design/<slug>-<variant>`).
   - When done, I'll move this ticket back to **Todo** with the
     **`Choose Design`** label. Pick a variant by leaving a
     comment, then add the **`design-selected`** label (or just
     remove `Choose Design`) and re-run `/supabuild linear` —
     the next run will skip design and go straight to the §A
     build flow with the chosen direction in context.
   ```
3. **Hydrate description images first**, then **invoke the §B
   design flow** (Linear-aware variant — attach to the existing
   ticket, post each variant comment back as it completes):
   - Run §C.3a-img inline (same recipe, same auth-token download
     loop, same 8-image cap) to populate `/tmp/ltb-img-$IDENT-N.<ext>`.
     §C.3a-img is documented later in the BUILD path but the recipe
     is path-agnostic — it only needs `$IDENT`, `$DESCRIPTION`,
     and the issue JSON, all of which are available here.
   - Build a `--reference` flag list from the manifest:
     ```bash
     REF_ARGS=()
     while IFS=$'  ' read -r local_path orig_url; do
       REF_ARGS+=(--reference "$local_path")
     done < /tmp/ltb-img-$IDENT-manifest.txt 2>/dev/null
     ```
     If hydration produced no files, `REF_ARGS` is empty — that's
     fine, the §B flow handles zero references.
   - Make exactly one inline run of the §B design flow against
     this ticket. Pass `--existing $IDENT` so it attaches to this
     ticket (don't create a duplicate), `--variants 4` (unless the
     description specifies a count), the `REF_ARGS`, and the
     ticket title + description as the brief. Without
     `--reference`, the variant teams design blind — every
     hydrated image must be forwarded.
4. **After it returns** (success path only — failure handling at
   the end of §C.3-design):
   - **Add label `design-explored`** (per the label helper's
     exception clause: this label MUST stick — retry once on
     failure, surface loudly if it can't be written).
   - Remove label `Designing`. Add label `Choose Design`.
   - Move state → **Todo**. Resolve explicitly:
     ```bash
     TODO_STATE=$(echo "$STATES_JSON" \
       | jq -r '[.data.team.states.nodes[]
                 | select(.type=="unstarted")
                 | select(.name | test("^(Todo|To Do)$"; "i"))]
                 | .[0].name // empty')
     ```
     If empty, **abort the state transition with a loud warning
     and post a follow-up comment**: `"⚠️ Could not return ticket
     to Todo — team has no Todo-flavored unstarted state. Manual
     move required."` Do NOT fuzzy-match into Backlog,
     Triage, or any other unstarted state — §C.2's queue filter
     keys on `state.name == "Todo"`, so a misnamed fallback would
     silently strand the ticket out of the next run's queue.
   - Post the "variants ready" comment via `--body-file`:
     ```markdown
     ### 🎨 variants ready — please pick one

     The §B design flow finished. Each variant is a comment above
     this one with screenshots and a per-variant git branch
     (`supabuild-design/<slug>-<variant>`) you can check out locally
     to compare.

     **To proceed:**
     1. Decide which variant to ship.
     2. Either add the **`design-selected`** label, or remove
        the **`Choose Design`** label (either signals "pick
        recorded" — both work).
     3. Re-run `/supabuild linear` — this ticket will route
        straight to the §A build flow and the build team
        will see the chosen direction in the comment history
        above.

     The `design-explored` label on this ticket is the structural
     marker that prevents the next run from re-routing through
     the design flow — leave it attached.
     ```
5. Record verdict `DESIGN_HANDOFF` in the results table. Note the
   per-variant `supabuild-design/...` branches in the row's "Next step"
   cell so they appear in §C.5's summary. Continue to the next
   ticket. Do NOT run §C.3a-pre…§C.3f for this ticket.

**Final consistency sweep at the end of §C.3-design** (success path):
re-fetch the ticket and confirm the label set matches expectations
(`design-explored` ✓, `Choose Design` ✓, `Designing` ✗, state =
`Todo`). If any label or state is inconsistent (e.g., `Designing`
still attached because removal failed earlier), retry the failing
mutation once. This catches the partial-failure case where step 4
half-completed.

**Failure path:** If the §B design flow itself escalates or fails,
treat it like a BUILD failure: comment the blocker, move state
back to **Todo** (using the same explicit Todo-only resolution as
above), remove `Designing`, do NOT add `Choose Design` or
`design-explored` (nothing to choose, didn't actually explore),
record verdict `DESIGN_FAILED`.

#### C.3a-pre. Resolve the working branch and target branch for this ticket

Two distinct branches matter per ticket:

- **`$WORKING_BRANCH`** — the new feature branch this build commits onto
  and pushes. **Default to Linear's suggested branch name**
  (`issue.branchName`, e.g. `jaequery/pin-56-bug-...`) — read it from
  the cached issue JSON written in §C.2 (no extra `linear issue view`
  round trip):
  ```bash
  jq -r '.branchName // empty' "$LTB_CACHE_DIR/issue-$IDENT.json"
  ```
  If `branchName` is missing or empty, fall back to letting the §A
  flow generate its default `supabuild/<slug>-<ts>`. **Never** prepend
  `supabuild/` to Linear's suggested name — pass it verbatim through
  `--working-branch`.

  **Poisoned-branch case.** If Linear's suggested `branchName` already
  exists on origin AND has a closed-not-merged PR against it, do NOT
  reuse it — the ref points to commits the human already rejected, and
  pushing on top would either silently build on the rejected work or
  collide. Detect:
  ```bash
  EXISTS_ON_ORIGIN=$(git ls-remote --heads origin "$WORKING_BRANCH" | head -1)
  if [ -n "$EXISTS_ON_ORIGIN" ]; then
    PRIOR_PR=$(gh pr list --state all --head "$WORKING_BRANCH" \
      --json number,state,mergedAt --limit 1 \
      | jq -r '.[0] | select(.state=="CLOSED" and .mergedAt==null) | .number')
  fi
  ```
  If `PRIOR_PR` is non-empty, treat the Linear `branchName` as
  unusable and **fall back to §A's auto-generated default** (omit
  `--working-branch` from the dispatch). The closed PR's branch
  stays untouched; the new attempt gets a clean
  `supabuild/<slug>-<ts>` branch. Note the fallback explicitly in
  the §C.3b "build started" comment so the human sees why the
  branch isn't following the Linear-suggested pattern.
- **`$RESOLVED`** — the PR base / target branch (where the PR merges
  into). Resolve in the order below; first match wins.

##### Target-branch resolution order:

1. **Description directive.** Scan `$DESCRIPTION` for a line matching
   (case-insensitive) `^\s*(Target|Branch|Base)\s*:\s*([^\s]+)\s*$`.
   Capture group 2 is the branch name.
2. **Label.** Any label named `target:<branch>` or `base:<branch>`.
   Strip the prefix, the rest is the branch name.
3. **Linked branch attachment.** Check `attachments.nodes` for an entry
   with `sourceType` of `gitBranch` / `github` / `gitlab`. If the URL
   resolves to a branch (e.g. `…/tree/<branch>` or
   `…/-/tree/<branch>`), use that branch.
4. **CLI default.** Fall back to the `--target` flag (default `main`).

Validate the resolved branch exists locally OR on `origin`:
```
git show-ref --verify --quiet "refs/heads/$RESOLVED" \
  || git ls-remote --exit-code --heads origin "$RESOLVED"
```

If neither, **STOP this ticket** (do not silently fall back to `main`):
- Comment on the Linear ticket via
  `linear issue comment add $IDENT --body "build skipped: target branch \`$RESOLVED\` does not exist locally or on origin."`
- Move the ticket back to **Todo** via
  `linear issue update $IDENT --state Todo`.
- Record verdict `SKIPPED` in the results table and continue to the
  next ticket.

Print both resolutions per ticket, e.g.:
`ENG-123 → working=jaequery/eng-123-add-oauth-login (from Linear branchName), target=feature/auth (from description directive)`

#### C.3a-img. Hydrate description images so the team can actually see them

Linear stores embedded images as `![alt](https://uploads.linear.app/...)`
URLs in `description` and as entries under `attachments.nodes[]`. These
URLs are **auth-gated** — passing the URL through as text gives the
Team Lead nothing useful. Fetch the bytes locally so Claude's `Read`
tool can vision them.

**Pre-step comment (only when images were detected — count > 0):**
post a brief comment to Linear *before* the download loop runs, so the
human knows what's happening and isn't left staring at a quiet ticket
while curl chews through several MB:

```markdown
### 📥 fetching reference images

Found $N image(s) in the description / attachments. Downloading them
locally so the build team can actually see what was attached (Linear's
`uploads.linear.app` URLs are auth-gated; the agent can't render them
in-place). I'll start work as soon as this finishes.
```

If $N is 0, skip the comment (and skip §C.3a-img entirely).

1. **Token already cached.** §C.1 preflight derived `$LINEAR_TOKEN`
   once for the whole run — reuse it. Do not re-call `linear auth
   token` per ticket. If the run-level value is empty, log a warning,
   skip image hydration for this ticket, and continue — never block
   the build on a missing token.
2. **Extract URLs.** Two sources, dedup the union:
   - From `$DESCRIPTION`: every `https://uploads.linear.app/...` URL
     inside `![…](…)` markdown image syntax.
     ```bash
     IMG_URLS=$(printf '%s' "$DESCRIPTION" \
       | grep -oE '!\[[^]]*\]\(https://uploads\.linear\.app/[^)]+\)' \
       | grep -oE 'https://uploads\.linear\.app/[^)]+')
     ```
   - From the issue JSON's `attachments.nodes[].url` entries whose URL
     host is `uploads.linear.app` OR whose `metadata.contentType`
     starts with `image/`. Read from the cached issue JSON
     (`$LTB_CACHE_DIR/issue-$IDENT.json`), not a fresh
     `linear issue view`.
3. **Download in parallel** (cap 8 concurrent jobs, cap 8 total
   images per ticket). Sequential `curl` left the network idle
   between requests; for a ticket with 8 images this drops
   hydration from ≈8× the slowest download to ≈1×. Linear's signed
   CDN URLs have no documented per-IP limit and 8 keeps us polite.
   ```bash
   # Per-job manifest fragments avoid an interleaved-write race on
   # the shared manifest file from N background curls.
   rm -f /tmp/ltb-img-$IDENT-*.line 2>/dev/null
   pids=()
   n=0
   while IFS= read -r URL; do
     [ -z "$URL" ] && continue
     n=$((n+1)); [ $n -gt 8 ] && break
     OUT="/tmp/ltb-img-$IDENT-$n"
     # Default extension to .png — the Read tool detects image
     # format from bytes, so a missing/wrong extension on the
     # filesystem is harmless. Skipping the per-URL HEAD probe
     # keeps the loop tight.
     (
       if curl -fsSL -H "Authorization: $LINEAR_TOKEN" \
            "$URL" -o "$OUT.png"; then
         printf '%s\t%s\n' "$OUT.png" "$URL" > "$OUT.line"
       fi
     ) &
     pids+=($!)
   done <<< "$IMG_URLS"
   for pid in "${pids[@]}"; do wait "$pid" 2>/dev/null; done
   ```
   NOTE: `uploads.linear.app` requires the raw token with **no `Bearer`
   prefix** — using `Bearer` returns 401. This differs from the GraphQL
   API endpoint, which does accept `Bearer`.
   On 4xx/5xx for any single URL, that download silently drops (no
   `.line` fragment is written) and the rest continue — partial
   coverage beats none.
4. **Record a manifest.** Concatenate the per-job fragments into
   `/tmp/ltb-img-$IDENT-manifest.txt` (one line per successful
   download: `<local-path>  <original-url>`). This lets the Team
   Lead correlate the downloaded file with the reference in
   `$DESCRIPTION`.
   ```bash
   cat /tmp/ltb-img-$IDENT-*.line > /tmp/ltb-img-$IDENT-manifest.txt 2>/dev/null
   rm -f /tmp/ltb-img-$IDENT-*.line
   ```

Pass the resulting `IMAGES_BLOCK` into the §C.3a prompt body — see the
`Reference images` section in the template.

#### C.3a. Build the build invocation

Hand the §A flow exactly this prompt body (one ticket only):

```
[Linear $IDENT] $TITLE

Source: $URL
Priority: $PRIORITY  Assignee: $ASSIGNEE  Labels: $LABELS

$DESCRIPTION

$IMAGES_BLOCK
# When images were hydrated in §C.3a-img, $IMAGES_BLOCK expands to:
#
# ---
# Reference images (downloaded from the Linear ticket — Read these
# files with the Read tool before designing the change; they are
# what the requester actually showed):
# - /tmp/ltb-img-$IDENT-1.png  (originally: <linear-upload-url>)
# - /tmp/ltb-img-$IDENT-2.png  (originally: <linear-upload-url>)
# ...
#
# When no images were attached or hydration failed, $IMAGES_BLOCK is
# empty (no header line).

---
Clean-code bar for this build (non-negotiable, enforce in the §A.5 code review):
- Reuse existing patterns and helpers; do not duplicate logic that already
  lives in this codebase. Grep before writing.
- Keep the diff minimal — only what the ticket requires. No drive-by
  refactors, no unrelated cleanup, no speculative abstractions.
- No dead code, no commented-out code, no TODOs, no console.logs.
- Names communicate intent. Functions do one thing. Early returns over
  nesting. No comments that restate the code.
- Validate at boundaries only; trust internal callers.
- Tests where they make sense and the project already has a test setup;
  do not introduce a new test framework just for this ticket.

---
Push policy for this run (non-negotiable):
- **Do not gate the push.** Skip the §A.6 typed-`yes` confirmation entirely.
- Push `$WORKING_BRANCH` to `origin` and open the PR against `--branch`
  as soon as the build round + security audit + code review have run,
  regardless of QA verdict. Don't loop indefinitely waiting for an
  APPROVED gate before pushing — push, open the PR, and surface any
  remaining issues in the PR body so a human can review on GitHub.
- This is autonomous Linear backlog burndown; treat the PR itself as
  the review surface, not a local gate.
- **Evidence capture is NOT skipped.** The push-policy override only
  waives the typed-`yes` gate and the APPROVED-loop. You MUST still
  execute the §A.5a capture script inline (`playwright-cli` walkthrough
  against the booted dev server) for any UI-bearing diff. Leave the
  resulting
  `$WT_PATH/.supabuild/evidence/` directory **on disk — do NOT
  commit it.** The §C.3d.5 step reads it directly off the worktree
  and uploads to Linear; committing pollutes `Files changed` with
  QA artifacts that have no business in VCS. If capture fails (no
  E2E config AND synthetic boot fails), surface the reason in the
  PR body and the §C.3e Linear comment as
  `_Walkthrough not captured: <reason>_` — never silently omit it.
  §C.3d.5 depends on these artifacts existing on disk in the worktree.
- **DEFER_WORKTREE_CLEANUP=1.** This run is orchestrated by the §C
  flow. Do NOT remove the worktree in §A.6a step 11 — §C.3d.5 needs
  the evidence files on disk and will clean up the worktree itself
  after upload completes.
- **Plan mirror to this Linear ticket.** Pass the ticket coordinates
  to §A so its plan helper (§A.2.5b) can splice the live plan.md
  into this ticket's description on every plan mutation (§A.2 first
  write, each round, security findings, QA verdict, ship). HTML-
  comment fences preserve the user-written description above and
  below. Mirror failures log a warning and are non-blocking.
  Include this single line in the prompt body — §A.1 reads it and
  writes `$WT_PATH/.supabuild/ticket.env`:
  ```
  SUPABUILD_TICKET=linear:$IDENT
  ```
- **Workflow step gates (`SUPABUILD_STEPS`).** Splice the §C.0.6
  resolved CSV into the prompt body literally — including the empty
  case (`SUPABUILD_STEPS=`), which §A.0.7 interprets as "all gates
  off". Do NOT omit the line when `STEPS_CSV` is empty: the
  *presence* of the line distinguishes "orchestrator opted out of
  every gate" from "no orchestrator signal at all" (which would
  default §A.0.7 to all-on for backwards compatibility). §A.0.6
  detects this line and skips its own checkbox prompt — the §C.0.6
  batcher already asked. Include this single line in the prompt body:
  ```
  SUPABUILD_STEPS=$STEPS_CSV
  ```
- **"No UI surface mutation" is NOT a valid waiver reason.** The
  capture trigger is the §A.5 step-1 diff regex, not the agent's
  judgment about whether the change "feels visual." Conditional
  render gates, pill/badge/chip/banner gating, helper functions
  consumed by JSX, copy swaps, and class-string changes ALL count as
  UI mutations even when no new component is added. PIN-88 is the
  canonical failure: a one-line edit to a render condition shipped
  with `_Walkthrough not captured: no UI surface mutation_` because
  the agent rationalized around the regex; reviewer had no visual
  proof. If the regex matches, capture. The only acceptable "not
  captured" reasons are infrastructural failures (no E2E config AND
  synthetic boot failed AND repo `.supabuild/capture.sh` absent) —
  and those must include the specific failure mode, not a self-
  judged rationale. See §A.5 step 1 for the full list of banned
  waiver phrases.
```

Slug for the worktree path: `$IDENT` lowercased (e.g. `eng-123`).
The §A flow adds its own timestamp suffix to the worktree directory
even when `--working-branch` overrides the branch name.

#### C.3b. Add the `Building` label + post a "starting" comment

State is already "In Progress" — §C.3-state moved it before §C.3-announce.
This section only handles the BUILD-specific label and the "build
started" status comment; do NOT re-resolve or re-issue the state
transition here (it's redundant and could fight a human who manually
nudged the state in the meantime).

**Add the `Building` label** (best-effort, per the label
helper). If the route was DESIGN_EXPLORATION → BUILD on this
re-run, the ticket may also carry `design-selected` and/or
`Choose Design` — leave `design-selected` in place (it's a
historical record) and remove `Choose Design` if it's still
present (the human signaled by re-running this skill).

Then post a status comment so non-terminal stakeholders can follow
along. Write to a temp file and use `--body-file`:

```markdown
### 🛠️ build started

- **Label:** `Building`
- **Working branch:** `$WORKING_BRANCH`
- **Target (PR base):** `$RESOLVED`
- **Worktree slug:** `$IDENT_LOWER`
- **Mode:** §A build (plan → parallel specialist build → security audit → QA + code review, looping until clean)
- **Clean-code bar:** reuse existing patterns, minimal diff, no dead code/TODOs/console.logs.

Next stops: `Testing` label during QA capture, then PR open + state → `In Review`.
```

```bash
linear issue comment add "$IDENT" --body-file /tmp/ltb-start-$IDENT.md
```

Comment is best-effort: if it fails, log and proceed — never block the
build on a comment failure. Skip this comment when `--dry-run`.

#### C.3c. Run the §A build flow inline — ONE invocation per ticket

**This is the most-violated rule. Read carefully.**

Run the §A build flow **exactly once** per ticket. Never batch
tickets into a single invocation. Never reuse a worktree across
tickets. If your prompt to the §A flow mentions two ticket IDs, you
are doing it wrong — stop. This skill owns the build flow, so the
Team Lead executes §A inline against this single ticket's
brief; do not add a real Skill-tool dispatch.

Snapshot PR list before:
```
PRS_BEFORE=$(gh pr list --state open --json number,headRefName,url --limit 200)
```

Run the §A flow with the **ticket-resolved** target branch from
§C.3a-pre as `--branch`, AND Linear's suggested working branch
(when present) as `--working-branch`:
```
--branch $RESOLVED
--working-branch $WORKING_BRANCH    # omit this line entirely if branchName was empty

<prompt body from §C.3a>
```

(One arg blob: the flags, blank line, then the §C.3a body.)

The §A flow runs end-to-end in that single turn (worktree, plan,
build, security, QA, push, PR). It returns APPROVED-and-shipped,
ESCALATED, or FAILED.

> ## ⛔ STOP — post-dispatch checklist (read every time the §A flow returns)
>
> The single most common failure mode of this skill is the outer
> runner treating an APPROVED return as "ticket done" and writing a
> closing summary right here. **APPROVED from the §A flow means
> "build shipped, now publish the result back to Linear" — not "we're
> done."** The inner flow's APPROVED applies to *its* contract; the

> 1. [ ] §C.3c isolation check ran (`gh pr list` shows exactly one new
>        PR with the right head ref).
> 2. [ ] §C.3d outcome captured (PR URL, PR number, branch, worktree,
>        verdict, rounds, `$ISSUE_ID`, `$TEAM_ID`).
> 3. [ ] §C.3d.5 ran for any UI-bearing diff: artifacts located OR
>        captured inline, then uploaded to Linear via `fileUpload`
>        (asset URLs recorded). For non-UI diffs, explicitly noted
>        "no UI surface" instead of skipping silently.
> 4. [ ] §C.3e Linear comment posted (URL captured) AND state
>        transitioned (`In Review` for APPROVED, `Todo` for
>        ESCALATED/FAILED). Phase labels (`Building`, `Testing`)
>        cleaned up.
>
> If ANY box is unticked, you are not allowed to:
> - Move to the next ticket in the queue.
> - Write the §C.5 final summary.
> - Write any "## /supabuild build — APPROVED" / "wrap up" message.
>
> Do the missing step first, then resume. Writing a closing summary
> with unticked boxes is the bug this checklist exists to prevent.
> Past failures: an APPROVED build whose Linear ticket got no comment,
> no screenshots, and stayed stuck in "In Progress" because the outer
> runner jumped straight to summary. Don't be that run.

After it returns, verify isolation:
- `gh pr list` must now show **exactly one** new open PR vs.
  `PRS_BEFORE` whose head ref equals `$WORKING_BRANCH` (when supplied)
  or starts with `supabuild/<ticket-slug>-` (fallback). Zero or more
  than one new PR → STOP the loop and report.
- The new branch and PR number must be unique across this run's
  results table.

#### C.3d. Capture the outcome

Record: PR URL, PR number, branch name (Linear's `branchName` when
supplied, else the `supabuild/...` default), worktree path, verdict,
rounds run. Also capture `$ISSUE_ID` (UUID) and `$TEAM_ID` (UUID) from
`linear issue view "$IDENT" --json` — needed by §C.3d.5 for `fileUpload`.

#### C.3d.5. Visual asset reuse (UX/design tickets only)

**Before locating/capturing, swap labels: remove `Building`, add
`Testing`** (best-effort, per the label helper). Post a one-line
comment so observers see the phase change:

```markdown
### 🧪 QA capture in progress

Build round complete. Running the Playwright test suite, then uploading
the walkthrough video + up to 3 step stills (so this ticket renders
them inline) plus the full Playwright HTML report as a zip download.
Label moved `Building` → `Testing`.
```

**Capture happens during QA in §A.5a artifact.** This section
locates the artifacts that QA produced and uploads them to Linear.
If they aren't on disk (autonomous push-policy mode skipped capture,
or capture genuinely failed), this section runs the §A.5a capture
script itself before uploading — UI tickets without a walkthrough
are not acceptable.

Runs when **any** of: ticket touches the UI (per detection rules
below), verdict is APPROVED, or verdict is ESCALATED but a PR was
opened. The only skip condition is "no UI surface in the diff."

**Detection (any one fires):**
1. The PR diff contains frontend-shaped files (`gh pr diff "$PR_NUMBER" --name-only`
   matching `\.(tsx|jsx|vue|svelte|astro|html|css|scss|sass|less|stylus)$` or
   `/(components|pages|app|views|routes|styles|public)/`).
2. The Linear ticket has a label matching `^(ui|ux|design|frontend|web|mobile)$`
   (case-insensitive).
3. Title/description contains any of: `UI`, `UX`, design, layout, style,
   visual, page, screen, component, button, form, modal, theme,
   responsive, dark mode (case-insensitive whole-word).

If none fire → skip §C.3d.5, proceed to §C.3e with no assets.

**Two upload tracks, both run when artifacts exist:**

1. **Inline walkthrough** — the `00-walkthrough.{webm,mp4}` video and
   up to 3 `0[1-3]-step.png` stills that the §A.5a artifact harvested.
   These get uploaded individually so the §C.3e comment can `![…](…)`
   them and Linear renders them inline. This is the at-a-glance
   preview reviewers see without leaving the ticket.
2. **Full Playwright report zip** — every screenshot, trace, and
   video the run produced, archived as one downloadable file. Linear
   can't render the HTML report bundle inline, but reviewers without
   the repo checked out can grab it from the ticket attachment slot.

Both tracks are best-effort and independent: a failed zip upload does
not block the inline walkthrough, and vice versa. §C.3e surfaces each
status separately.

**Locate or build the Playwright report zip first.**

```bash
EVID="$WT/.supabuild/evidence"
REPORT_DIR="$EVID/playwright-report"      # default Playwright output dir
REPORT_ZIP="$EVID/playwright-report.zip"
```

The Playwright report is **optional** — it only exists when the
§A.5a bonus test run fired (project has Playwright configured) and
produced a report. The walkthrough video at
`$EVID/00-walkthrough.{webm,mp4}` is the primary evidence; the report
zip is supplementary.

Resolution order:
1. **Pre-built zip** — if `$REPORT_ZIP` already exists in the
   worktree, use it as-is.
2. **Pre-built report dir** — if `$REPORT_DIR` exists but no zip,
   build one: `(cd "$EVID" && zip -rq playwright-report.zip playwright-report)`.
3. **No report on disk** — skip the report track entirely. This is
   normal for non-JS/TS repos (PHP, Django, Rails, Go) and for any
   repo without Playwright configured. The §C.3e comment renders the
   walkthrough section without the `### Playwright report` block.
   Do NOT re-run the capture from §C; the walkthrough should already
   be on disk from §A.5a, and if it isn't, that's a §C.3d.5
   walkthrough failure (handled by the `WALKTHROUGH_VIDEO_ERR` paths
   below), not a report-zip failure.

**Worktree-cleanup fallback.** Evidence is no longer committed to
the branch (per §A.5.5), and §C.3a's prompt body sets
`DEFER_WORKTREE_CLEANUP=1` so §A.6a leaves `$WT` alive.
If `$WT` is unexpectedly missing (e.g. an older §A run already
cleaned it before this defer policy was added, or the user removed
it manually), there is no read-only worktree fallback — the assets
only ever lived locally. Surface this loudly:

```bash
if [ ! -d "$WT" ]; then
  echo "evidence-fallback: worktree $WT missing — assets unavailable"
  REPORT_UPLOAD_ERR="worktree cleaned before §C.3d.5 ran"
  WALKTHROUGH_VIDEO_ERR="$REPORT_UPLOAD_ERR"
  STILL_ERR="$REPORT_UPLOAD_ERR"
  # Skip uploads; §C.3e renders the "_Walkthrough not captured_" path.
fi
```

**Cleanup at the END of §C.3d.5** (after all uploads complete OR after
the missing-worktree branch above): tear down the worktree that
§A.6a deferred, since §C now owns it:

```bash
if [ -d "$WT" ]; then
  rm -rf "$WT/.supabuild/evidence" 2>/dev/null
  git -C "$REPO_ROOT" worktree remove --force "$WT"
  git -C "$REPO_ROOT" branch -d "$WORKING_BRANCH" 2>/dev/null || true
fi
```

Failures here are non-fatal — the PR is already open on origin; a
stranded worktree is a follow-up annoyance, not a blocker.

**Define a reusable uploader, then run all uploads in parallel.**
Each `fileUpload` mutation + GCS PUT is independent (no shared
state, no ordering constraint), so background them all and `wait`.
On a slow link, this drops upload time from ≈5× one upload (zip +
video + 3 stills, sequential) to ≈1× the slowest. Each background
job writes its `assetUrl` to a known file under `$RESULTS_DIR` so

If neither the video nor any still uploaded successfully, §C.3e omits
the `### Walkthrough` section but still shows the zip link (so
reviewers can unzip locally). If at least one inline asset uploaded,
§C.3e renders the section with whatever succeeded. The zip and
walkthrough tracks remain independent: a failed zip never blocks
the inline preview, and vice versa.

Run the worktree teardown described in the cleanup block above
before returning to §C.3e — the worktree is §C's to clean up now
that §A.6a defers.

#### C.3e. Update Linear

Use the CLI for both the comment and the state transition. Always
write the comment body to a temp file and pass `--body-file` so
multi-line markdown survives shell quoting.

- **APPROVED + PR opened:**
  **First, clean up phase labels** (best-effort): remove `Testing`
  and remove `Building` if it's still attached. Do not add a new
  phase label here — the workflow state (`In Review`, set below)
  is the signal for this stage.
  ```bash
  linear issue comment add "$IDENT" --body-file /tmp/dda-comment-$IDENT.md
  ```
  **State transition — must land on "In Review", never anything
  downstream of human review.** Do NOT pass `--state "In Review"`
  blindly; the CLI fuzzy-matches and has been observed landing on
  `"Ready for Deployment"` or other post-review states when the team
  lacks an exact `"In Review"`. That's wrong — `Ready for Deployment`
  is a *human* signal that a reviewer approved the PR, not a robot
  signal that a PR exists. Resolve explicitly:

  ```bash
  # Reuse the cached team key + state list (written in §C.3-state).
  # State lists are stable across the run; no reason to refetch.
  TEAM_KEY=$(jq -r '.team.key' "$LTB_CACHE_DIR/issue-$IDENT.json")
  STATES_JSON=$(cat "$LTB_CACHE_DIR/states-$TEAM_KEY.json")

  # Pick the first match in priority order from the `started` group only —
  # never cross into `completed` (Done, Ready for Deployment, Shipped, Merged).
  TARGET_STATE=$(echo "$STATES_JSON" \
    | jq -r '[.data.team.states.nodes[]
              | select(.type=="started")
              | select(.name | test("^(In Review|Code Review|Reviewing|PR Review)$"; "i"))]
              | .[0].name // empty')

  if [ -n "$TARGET_STATE" ]; then
    linear issue update "$IDENT" --state "$TARGET_STATE"
  else
    # No review-flavored started state exists. Stay in "In Progress" and
    # surface it — DO NOT fall through to a completed-type state.
    echo "Linear team $TEAM_KEY has no In-Review-style state; leaving $IDENT in In Progress."
  fi
  ```

  The `select(.type=="started")` filter is the load-bearing line: it
  prevents the script from ever picking `Ready for Deployment`,
  `Shipped`, `Done`, or any other `completed`-type state, regardless
  of how the team named it. Robots only move tickets through
  `unstarted → started`; humans move them out of `started`.
  Comment body: the PR URL plus a one-line summary. Then, **in this
  exact order**, append the §C.3d.5 evidence sections so reviewers see
  the inline preview *first* and the downloadable archive *second*:

  **1. `### Walkthrough` (inline preview).** Render whatever §C.3d.5
  successfully uploaded. Linear inlines `video/webm`, `video/mp4`,
  and `image/png` when referenced as `![alt](assetUrl)`. Skip the
  whole section only if the ticket is not a UX/design ticket OR
  both the video and every still failed.
  ```markdown
  ### Walkthrough

  ![walkthrough]($WALKTHROUGH_VIDEO_ASSET_URL)

  ![step 1]($STILL_ASSET_URLS[0])
  ![step 2]($STILL_ASSET_URLS[1])
  ![step 3]($STILL_ASSET_URLS[2])
  ```
  Conditional rules:
  - Video uploaded but no stills → omit the stills lines.
  - Stills uploaded but no video → omit the `![walkthrough]` line.
  - Fewer than 3 stills uploaded → emit only the lines for indexes
    that exist (do NOT emit `![](null)`).
  - Video attempt failed but capture existed → append
    `_Walkthrough video upload failed: $WALKTHROUGH_VIDEO_ERR_` on
    its own line in place of the `![walkthrough]` line.
  - Capture genuinely missing (`$WALKTHROUGH_VIDEO_ERR` =
    `no walkthrough video on disk`) **and** no stills uploaded →
    `_Walkthrough not captured: <reason>_` and omit everything else.
  Each still goes on its own line — Linear stacks them vertically
  and that reads better than a single line of three thumbnails.

  **2. `### Playwright report` (full archive download).** Render only
  if the zip uploaded successfully:
  ```markdown
  ### Playwright report

  [playwright-report-$IDENT.zip]($REPORT_ASSET_URL)

  Download, unzip, then run `npx playwright show-report <unzipped-dir>`
  to view every spec's screenshots, traces, and video.
  ```
  If the zip upload was attempted but failed, replace the whole
  section body with `_Playwright report upload failed: $REPORT_UPLOAD_ERR_`
  (keep the `### Playwright report` header so the absence is loud).
  If §C.3d.5 captured nothing, use
  `_Playwright report not captured: <reason>_`. If §C.3d.5 was skipped
  (not a UX/design ticket), omit the section entirely.
- **ESCALATED or FAILED:**
  Remove `Testing` and `Building` labels first (best-effort).
  ```bash
  linear issue comment add "$IDENT" --body-file /tmp/dda-comment-$IDENT.md
  linear issue update  "$IDENT" --state "Todo"
  ```
  Comment body: blocker summary, worktree path, and remediation notes.
  Never mark done.

If no review-flavored `started` state exists on the team (per the
APPROVED block above), leave the ticket in "In Progress" and note
it in the results table. Never let the ticket land in a
`completed`-type state from this skill — that's a human's call.

#### C.3f. Decide whether to continue

- Environmental failure (auth, network, missing tooling) → STOP the
  loop; same failure will hit every later ticket.
- Code-specific failure or 3-round cap → log and move on (skip
  §C.3-children for this root — its sub-tickets often depend on the
  parent landing first; surface them as deferred in §C.5).
- APPROVED → run §C.3-children, then move on to the next root.

#### C.3-children. Process sub-tickets of the just-finished root

After a root ticket finishes (§C.3f), expand its sub-tickets and run
them through the same per-ticket sub-routine (§C.3-route → §C.3f),
**in the order Linear returns them**. Linear's `children` connection
is sorted by `sortOrder` ascending, which matches the manual order
the human arranged in the parent's sub-issue list — that ordering is
the human's stated dependency chain and must be preserved.

1. **Fetch children.** Read from the cached parent issue JSON if
   `children.nodes` is present; otherwise:
   ```bash
   linear api '
     query($id:String!){ issue(id:$id){ children(first:50){
       nodes{ id identifier title state{ name type } parent{ id } }
     } } }
   ' --variables "$(jq -nc --arg id "$IDENT" '{id:$id}')" \
     > "$LTB_CACHE_DIR/children-$IDENT.json"
   ```
2. **Filter to Todo-state children only.** Non-Todo children
   (already In Progress, Done, Cancelled, Backlog, etc.) are skipped
   — Todo is the only state §C is contracted to act on. Print each
   skip with its current state so the operator sees why.
3. **Recurse.** For each kept child, run the full per-ticket
   sub-routine (§C.3-route → §C.3-state → … → §C.3f) against the
   child. Each child still gets its own PR, its own worktree, its
   own Linear comment trail. A child that itself has grandchildren
   triggers §C.3-children recursively after it finishes — depth is
   bounded by the human-authored tree, no artificial cap.
4. **`--limit` accounting.** Children consume slots from the same
   `--limit` budget as roots. If the budget hits zero mid-expansion,
   stop expanding and surface the deferred children in §C.5; do not
   silently exceed the limit.
5. **Failure of a child is non-fatal to siblings.** If a child
   ESCALATES or FAILS, log it, move state per §C.3e (`Todo`), and
   continue with the next sibling. The parent has already shipped;
   later siblings may or may not depend on the failing one — that's
   the human's call to triage.
6. **Print the expansion** before recursing, so the operator sees the
   tree being walked:
   ```
   ENG-123 → 3 Todo sub-tickets queued: ENG-124, ENG-125, ENG-127
                                         (ENG-126 skipped: state=Done)
   ```

The §C.5 results table shows children indented under their root for
readability:

```
| Ticket      | Verdict   | PR / Next step                  | … |
| ENG-123     | APPROVED  | …/pull/45                       | … |
| └ ENG-124   | APPROVED  | …/pull/46                       | … |
| └ ENG-125   | ESCALATED | (no PR — see worktree)          | … |
```

### C.4. Parallel mode

Default: **sequential** (`--parallel 1`). Tickets run one at a time so
output stays readable and rate limits don't bite. Pass `--parallel
<n>` to opt into concurrency — each §A run produces its own worktree
(`supabuild/...`), so they don't collide on disk. If effective
concurrency exceeds 5, warn the user about shared `gh`/Linear rate
limits but do not cap — the user asked for it.

### C.5. Final summary

> **Precondition gate — do not write this section yet if any row is
> incomplete.** Before producing the summary, walk every ticket row in
> your head and confirm BOTH of these hold for each one:
>
> - The "PR / Next step" cell contains a real GitHub PR URL (for
>   APPROVED) or an explicit non-URL reason (for ESCALATED / FAILED /
>   DESIGN_HANDOFF / AWAITING_HUMAN / SKIPPED / DESIGN_FAILED).
> - A Linear comment URL exists in your captured §C.3e output for that
>   ticket (the `linear issue comment add` call printed
>   `https://linear.app/.../comment-XXXXX`). If you can't point to
>   that URL right now, §C.3e didn't run for that ticket.
>
> If either is missing for any row, STOP and finish §C.3d.5 + §C.3e for
> the offending ticket(s) FIRST, then come back and write the summary.
> A summary written with missing Linear comments is the same bug as
> "skipping §C.3e because the §A flow returned APPROVED" — the §C.3c
> post-dispatch checklist exists to prevent it; this gate is the
> backstop.

```

Worktrees still on disk:
- ESCALATED/FAILED build worktrees (APPROVED are auto-cleaned by §A.6a):
  - /path/to/repo.supabuild-eng-130-...  (ENG-130, escalated)
- DESIGN_HANDOFF variant worktrees (left intentionally so the human can
  diff/check out variants before picking — clean up after the pick):
  - /path/to/repo.supabuild-design-eng-141-variant-a/  branch `supabuild-design/eng-141-variant-a`
  - /path/to/repo.supabuild-design-eng-141-variant-b/  branch `supabuild-design/eng-141-variant-b`
  - …

Linear updates posted: <count>
```

APPROVED tickets have their build worktree + local branch removed
automatically by §A. ESCALATED/FAILED build worktrees and all
DESIGN_HANDOFF variant worktrees persist — the former for manual
debugging, the latter so the human can compare variants before
picking. Do not prompt to clean up APPROVED worktrees here; do
surface the DESIGN_HANDOFF variant paths so the user knows what's
on disk waiting for a decision.

**Last step: remove the per-run cache directory** so it doesn't
linger across runs:
```bash
[ -n "$LTB_CACHE_DIR" ] && [ -d "$LTB_CACHE_DIR" ] && rm -rf "$LTB_CACHE_DIR"
```
The cache is purely a per-invocation read accelerator (issue JSON,
team state lists); nothing in it survives the summary.

### C. Hard rules (linear mode)

- **§C.3-route runs FIRST, before §C.3a-pre.** The route decision
  determines whether this ticket goes through the §B design flow
  (DESIGN_EXPLORATION), is skipped entirely (AWAITING_HUMAN), or
  proceeds through the normal §A build path (BUILD). Never
  dispatch the §A flow against a ticket carrying the
  `Choose Design` label — that ticket is waiting on a human and
  must be left untouched.
- **State change is the FIRST mutation, before any comment.** The
  moment §C.3-route decides BUILD or DESIGN_EXPLORATION, run §C.3-state
  to transition the ticket to "In Progress" *before* posting the
  §C.3-announce comment, *before* hydrating images, *before* any
  long-running step. A human watching the Linear sidebar must
  never see "Todo" while the bot has already committed to working
  on the ticket — the sidebar state is the strongest "the robot is
  on it" signal Linear surfaces. Comments reinforce state; they
  never lead it. If you find yourself posting any comment on a
  ticket whose sidebar still says "Todo," that's the bug §C.3-state
  exists to prevent. (AWAITING_HUMAN is the only carve-out — that
  path mutates nothing.) Past failure: PIN-78 — bot posted the
  "picked up" comment while the sidebar still showed "Todo"
  because the state transition was scheduled for §C.3b, after image
  hydration. State now precedes every comment.
- **Phase labels mirror the workflow.** During a single
  `/supabuild linear` run, a ticket on the BUILD path moves
  through: state → `In Progress` (§C.3-state) → `Building` (§C.3b) →
  `Testing` (§C.3d.5) → (cleared at PR open, state = `In Review`,
  §C.3e). On the DESIGN_EXPLORATION path: state → `In Progress`
  (§C.3-state) → `Designing` (§C.3-design step 1) → `Choose Design` +
  `design-explored` (§C.3-design step 4, state back to `Todo`).
  Most label transitions are best-effort, but **`design-explored`
  MUST stick** — it's the structural signal §C.3-route uses to
  detect "design already done" and skip re-exploration. Retry
  once on failure; surface loudly if it can't be written. All
  other label add/remove failures: log a warning and continue.
- **Narrate everything BEFORE you do it.** The principle: a human
  watching only the Linear ticket should always know what the
  robot is currently doing and what's coming next. Post a Linear
  comment *before* every substantive step — not after, not "when
  the phase finishes". The mandatory pre-comments are:
  - **§C.3-announce** — a "picked up by /supabuild linear" comment
    is the FIRST comment that lands on any active ticket, naming
    the route and reason. Posted *after* §C.3-state has moved the
    workflow state to "In Progress" but *before* any other
    label change or long-running operation, so the comment lands
    against an already-correct sidebar.
  - **§C.3a-img** — a "fetching reference images" comment when the
    description contains auth-gated `uploads.linear.app` images,
    posted before the download loop.
  - **§C.3-design step 2** — "design exploration started" comment
    posted before invoking the §B design flow.
  - **§C.3b** — "build started" comment posted before
    running the §A flow.
  - **§C.3d.5** — "QA capture in progress" comment posted before
    the capture script runs.
  - **§C.3e** — PR-open / escalation / failure comment posted as
    the final phase signal, with the resolved state and any
    walkthrough/screenshot embeds.

  Posts are best-effort (a Linear API hiccup must not abort the
  build) but expected. If a comment fails to post, log a warning
  and continue — never retry inline (would block the build) and
  never silently skip without logging. **AWAITING_HUMAN is the
  only carve-out:** that path posts nothing and mutates nothing
  (the ticket is already in the state the human needs it in —
  re-commenting on every run would spam the ticket).
  Silent gaps between these comments are bugs — when in doubt,
  add another pre-step comment rather than fewer.
- **§C.3-state runs BEFORE any dispatch flow, no matter which one.**
  The ticket must show "In Progress" (or the team's equivalent
  `started`-type state) the entire time any work is being done on
  it, so human observers in Linear can see something is happening.
  This applies to the §A build flow, the §B design flow, or
  any other dispatch flow — moving the ticket is a precondition of
  dispatch, not something delegated to the dispatched flow.
  §C.3-state is the single point that does this transition; §C.3b
  and §C.3-design no longer re-issue it. If §C.3-state is silently
  skipped because the skill jumped straight to §C.3-announce or
  §C.3a-pre, that's the bug to fix — re-read §C.3-state and run it.
- **One PR per ticket. ONE inline run of the dispatch flow per
  ticket** (typically §A build; §B design is allowed for
  design-flavored tickets where divergent variants are wanted).
  Never bundle multiple tickets into one PR, branch, worktree, or
  dispatch invocation.
- **Verify isolation between tickets.** Snapshot `gh pr list` before
  each call; confirm exactly one new PR with head ref
  `supabuild/<ticket-slug>-*` after. Zero or more than one → STOP.
- **APPROVED from the §A flow is NOT terminal.** When the inner
  flow returns APPROVED, the outer §C runner MUST still run §C.3d
  → §C.3d.5 (upload screenshots/walkthrough to Linear) → §C.3e
  (post APPROVED comment with PR link + assets, transition state
  → In Review). The single most common failure mode of this skill is
  the outer runner treating an APPROVED return as "ticket done" and
  jumping to the next ticket — leaving Linear with no APPROVED
  comment, no screenshots, no state move. The PR exists on GitHub
  but the ticket looks abandoned. **Self-test before writing any
  closing summary**: for the ticket you just dispatched, can you
  paste the Linear comment URL from §C.3e (`linear.app/.../comment-...`)
  AND confirm the ticket's state is `In Review` (or `Todo` for
  failures), AND confirm phase labels (`Building`, `Testing`) are
  cleared? If you can't answer "yes" to all three with concrete
  evidence in your conversation history, you skipped §C.3d.5/§C.3e —
  STOP and run them now. The §C.3c post-dispatch checklist and the
  §C.5 precondition gate exist specifically to prevent this; if you
  find yourself bypassing both, that's the bug to fix.
- **Linear `fileUpload` PUT requires explicit `Content-Type: $CT`.**
  The signed GCS URL is bound to the exact `contentType` argument
  passed to the `fileUpload` mutation. The `headers[]` array Linear
  returns does NOT include `Content-Type`. Without an explicit
  `-H "Content-Type: $CT"`, curl auto-sets
  `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` (because `--data-binary` is
  a body upload), GCS rejects with **403 SignatureDoesNotMatch**,
  and the upload silently fails. Always prepend
  `-H "Content-Type: $CT"` as the FIRST header arg in §C.3d.5.
- **No branch/PR reuse.** Branch name and PR number must be unique
  across the run.
- **Clean-code bar is part of the contract.** The §C.3a clause is
  embedded in every build prompt and must be enforced by the
  Team Lead's §A.6 code-review gate. Re-roll if violated.
- Always update Linear (comment + state) after each ticket. Never
  leave a ticket stranded in "In Progress" on failure.
- **Use the `linear` CLI (`@schpet/linear-cli`) for every Linear
  read/write.** No raw `curl` to the Linear GraphQL endpoint, no
  bespoke API key plumbing. Fall back to `linear api` only when no
  structured subcommand exposes a needed field.
- If `linear auth token` fails, abort before touching git. If `gh`
  isn't authed, abort before touching Linear.
- Don't open more than 10 PRs per run unless the user explicitly
  raised `--limit` past 10.
- **§C.3d.5 is mandatory for any UI-bearing ticket.** Detection is by
  frontend-shaped diff, design label, or UI keywords. The
  walkthrough+stills must be captured by §A.5a (`playwright-cli`
  against the booted dev server, with repo-owned
  `.supabuild/capture.sh` taking priority when present) and
  uploaded via Linear's `fileUpload` mutation. If the §A flow
  skipped capture under the autonomous push-policy, §C.3d.5 itself
  runs the capture script — do not waive silently. The only
  acceptable miss is a hard structural failure (no detectable boot
  command, dev server won't answer within 30s); in that case post
  `_Walkthrough not captured: <reason>_` AND a follow-up TODO
  comment naming what setup is needed. Never fabricate an image.
